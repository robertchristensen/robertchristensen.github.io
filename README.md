I am a software developer working on machine learning topics.  I work on tooling to help data scientists be more productive.  I work on tools to help scientist create solutions, I do not create solutions myself.

My interests include more than work.  I also enjoy exploring math.  I am not expert at math, but enjoying something is enough for me to pursue it as a hobby.

I fold origami.  Most of the time the origami is made into jewelry, which in turn are often given to friends and family.
