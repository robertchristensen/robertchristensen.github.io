Periodically I think of something I would like to write about.  This might
be related to something software related, or something I found out about the
world.  It could even be a desire to explain something better then what I find
on existing blogs.  I need somewhere to put useful writings so I can at least
say I have some public information about a topic.  I expect few people will
read the contents of this site.  The purpose of the site is mostly to write
about things.  I don't trust search engines to do a good job making it
easy to find this information.

This blog is a solution for that.  Since my interests are diverse, it is possible
the writings here will also be diverse, covering anything I find interesting
and feel like I have sufficient knowledge to explain it to others.

In the past I have not done a lot of sharing.  The problem with this is I spend
a lot of time going through what other people share and find a lot of information
that is not very useful for my specific problems.  Hopefully what I write will
be useful or interesting to somebody else.
