# Introduction

I created this book as a location to put my thoughts. I don't expect many people will
read it, but I want a place to put things I think about so people can find it if they
are looking for what I have thought about.

I think it is important to explore thoughts when I have an idea. Now that llm models
are widely available, frequently people who have a question might just ask the llm and
it will give some answer. However, I have found the llm to be confusing unless the
question is widely asked. When somebody asks a new question to the llm people will post
the silly answers it gives but eventually the question will become widely asked and it
will start answering it a better way. Another issue with this is that me thinking
through a problems lets me explore the idea so I can think deeply about a topic so I
can be ready to think deeply about another topic.
