# Disney Trip in 2021

In 2021, for fall break my family visited Disneyland. In preparation my wife read
several blogs that describe ways to have the best experience. These blogs would
describe where to go at different parts of the day to try to maximize your time at
Disneyland.

I like to be data-centric. Since none of these blogs had supporting data, there is
no way to know if it would be better to do it one way or another. Also, objectives
might be different. Some people might be happy maximizing the number of rides,
others might want to try to go to each attraction at least once. Either way,
without data it is difficult to say what option is best.

I thought it might be interesting to collect some data about how I spent time at
Disneyland. I timed how long I waited in the queue for a ride and how long that
ride was. I tried my best to start the timer when I entered the queue and had a
spot in line. The length of the ride was when I got in the seat until when I got
out of the seat for the ride. Of course, the data is not precise, but it does give
an interesting perspective on how I spent time and the measured ride time for
various attractions. Sometimes I would stand in the queue but did not get on the
ride, either because the ride broke or because my kids decided they did not want
to wait longer.

I also collected data about how long it took for me to walk from place to place.
This data required a lot of context to understand, so I am not including it here.

My goal was to measure queue time and ride time to get a ratio of how much time I
spent in line verses how much time I was on a ride. I was not interested in
measuring how my time in the queue compared to the estimate Disney gives in the
Disneyland app. However, most of the time I found I spent less time than they
estimated. I assume when they generate an estimate they overestimate. For example,
when I got in line for the Guardians of the Galaxy ride the estimate was 90
minutes. I spent just over one hour until I was on the ride.

On the best day, the ratio of time waiting verses time on a ride was about 80:20.
On the worst day it was 90:10. However, the ratio for the whole day might not be
very useful since even on the last day of Disneyland half of the time on a ride
was on only two rides: Monsters Inc. and The Little Mermaid, while a lot of time
was spent waiting for Guardians of the Galaxy, which we did twice.

Even though the Spiderman web slingers ride requires people to enter a virtual
queue before entering the line, I still had to wait 47m7s in a physical line
before I could actually get on the ride. This was disappointing to me. I thought
the virtual queue would help reduce the physical queue length significantly.

I enjoyed my visit to Disney. I think I enjoyed it more because I recorded these
times and was able to see how I spent my time.
