# Projects

I have a few projects that keep me busy. Some notes that might be useful for
people looking at what I did.

## Bash based work queue

This is a small project where I implemented a batch processing queue using
`bash`. It will keep track of pending jobs and store the output of the executed
jobs as they run and after they finish. It includes an interface to look at the
output of a job.
