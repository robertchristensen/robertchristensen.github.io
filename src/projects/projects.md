# Projects

I have a few projects that keep me busy. Some notes that might be useful for
people looking at what I did.

[Benchtop Planer Controller](planer_controller/2025-overview.md)

## Benchtop Planer Controller

This project automates the depth adjustment of a benchtop planer. Rather than
manually turning a knob between each pass of wood through the planer, this
controller uses a motor to move the planer up or down by set increments. The
interface includes buttons and a foot pedal for hands-free operation while
working with wood.

## Bash based work queue

This is a small project where I implemented a batch processing queue using
`bash`. It will keep track of pending jobs and store the output of the executed
jobs as they run and after they finish. It includes an interface to look at the
output of a job.
